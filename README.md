# ConfigureVTKonVS

This is a tutorial for setting up VTK on Visual Studio without using CMake.
Still highly recommand that using CMake.

I am using VTK-6.1, which is compiled by VS2010 win32.
Further tutorial will add into this contents.
Hope this could help someone who wants to develop on Visual Studio.
